## Getting started

Here is a short introduction how to install and develop the application on a windows operating system by yourself.


### Prerequisites

First of all we need Node.js and npm.
Install desired Nodejs version. (nodejs v18.7.0 / npm v8.18.0)
* Step 1
  ```sh
  https://nodejs.org/
  ```
  
  Now, we need a good IDE to work with.
  * Step 2
  ```sh
  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/
  ```


### Installation

Now we go step for step, how to install the project.

1. Now start the Terminal and we install the used framework Angular to get the project work.(based on version 14.2)
   ```sh
   npm install @angular/cli@14
   ```
2. In the next step, we clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone
   ```
3. Now you have the project on your computer. In Visual Studio you have on the top the option `File`, click that. Now choose `Open folder` and select the folder of the cloned repo 

4. After you open the cloned repo in visual studio, you have to install the project on your computer
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Usage

This Project is about having your own portfolio page where you can show your personality, skills and your own projects.
